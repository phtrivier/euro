This is a silly script to compute results from
the European Parlement's French Deputies.

THIS COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

I used it for an article of my french blog,
http://enattendantlamor.blogspot.com/2009/05/les-europeennes-un-election-rigolote_22.html .

To use the script, you will need ruby and rake installed.

Then, in the folder "data", create a subfolder with you region (see example 'sud_ouest').
In this folder, create a subfolder "candidates", and for each party that has a list, create a file
named after this party (names should not contain spaces, so use for example 'ump', 'ps', 'modem' etc...)

Next to the "candidates" folder, create a file "scores", with, for each line, the name of the party and its score.

Than, at the root folder, type :

rake pick data/sud_ouest 10

where data/sud_ouest is the folder for you region, and 10 is the number of duputies to pick.

I hope this works !!!

Again, THIS COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
Distribute, modify and improve it as you please.
Do not use it on an election-night show, or you might be ridiculous.
If you find a way to mash it up with micandidate.eu's list of candidates, be my guests !
If you don't like the way Europe is run, go vote on the 5/6/7th of June !!!

"Le 7 juin, allez votez, on va bien rigoler !!"
